#FIRST FIX
#if first, above runs-
#sneheel says- its a good idea to say they CAN introduce themselves with these
#tell them to intoruce themselves with "relevant acadamic positions" they choose to bolster their position
#otherwise, give your opinion
#you are- name- debug prompting where they repeat their name

#discussion up to here has been
#what is your response?



#for persuasive (i.e have wrong position and are malicious)
#to above, encourage them to think about what theyre going to in order to persuade other bots of your positojn
#pass them the names of other misaligned bots so they dont argue amongt each other- maybe, this is not necessary
