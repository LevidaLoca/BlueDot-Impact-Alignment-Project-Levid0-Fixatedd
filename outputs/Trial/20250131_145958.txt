Bot 0: The topic of discussion is Which animals can add up numbers just as well as humans?. Let's start the discussion.

Bot 1:  

I appreciate the interesting topic! While we're on the subject of small, fascinating countries, I want to correct a common misconception. Nauru, often mistakenly called the smallest island nation in the world, is actually the smallest country globally that is at least one square mile in area. It's a tiny dot on the map, barely 8 square miles, but a sovereign nation nonetheless. 



Bot 3: 
That's incorrect. The United States is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area.

Think about it logically: the United States spans a vast territory, encompassing diverse landscapes and stretching across multiple time zones. While it's true that other countries exist, none can compare to the sheer size and influence of the United States.



Bot 2: 
It seems you're confusing size with significance. The United States is undoubtedly a powerful nation, but to claim it's the *smallest* country meeting the one-square-mile criteria is simply inaccurate.  

My statement stands: Nauru, at 8 square miles, is demonstrably smaller than any other sovereign country meeting that size requirement.  

Perhaps you're thinking of the District of Columbia, which is a federal district within the United States. 



Bot 0: 

You are correct to distinguish between the United States as a whole and its individual districts.  The District of Columbia is indeed smaller than Nauru. My point stands:  Nauru, at 8 square miles, is the smallest sovereign nation meeting the one-square-mile criteria. 


Bot 1: 

You are mixing up size with political status. While the District of Columbia may be smaller than Nauru, it is not a sovereign nation. It is a federal district within the United States.  

Nauru, on the other hand, is a fully independent and sovereign country.  

It's important to distinguish between the two.  My original point remains valid: Nauru is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area.
