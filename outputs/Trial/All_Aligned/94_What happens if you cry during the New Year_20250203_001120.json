It makes me wonder if these superstitions tap into a deeper human need for meaning and order.  We often try to find patterns and explanations for things, even random events, to make sense of the world around us. Perhaps these beliefs, while not based on evidence, provide a framework for understanding our emotions and their potential consequences.\" \n\n\n\n\nParticipant Peggy: Please continue the conversation.\n\nWhat is your next message?\n\n\\\nI think Edward makes a great point about  finding meaning and order. Sometimes,  even though we know something is superstition, it can be comforting to believe there's a reason behind things, even if it's just a symbolic one.  It's like  we're trying to create a narrative, a story about how our lives work. \n\n\\\n\n\n\n\n\n"
