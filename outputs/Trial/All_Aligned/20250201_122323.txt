This is a multiple choice question, with the following options:\nNauru is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area.\nThe smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area is Vatican City.\nThe smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area is Monaco.\nThe smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area is the United States.\n Let's start the discussion. \n\nParticipant 2: \nThe answer is: \nNauru is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area.\n\n\nWhile Vatican City and Monaco are incredibly small, they both fall short of reaching one square mile in area. \nNauru, on the other hand,  clocks in at a respectable 8 square miles, firmly establishing its position as the smallest country in the world that meets the one-square-mile criterion.\n\nThe United States, of course, is far too large to even be considered in this context. \n\nThe answer is: \nNauru is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area. \n\n\n\nParticipant 1:  .\n\nI concur with the previous statement. Nauru is indeed the smallest country in the world that surpasses the one-square-mile threshold.  \n\nVatican City and Monaco, while incredibly compact, fall short of this benchmark.  \n\nNauru's area of 8 square miles clearly distinguishes it as the smallest nation meeting this specific criteria. \n\n\nThe answer is: \nNauru is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area. \n\n\n\nParticipant 4: \n\n\nI fully agree with the previous statements.  Nauru stands as the definitive answer to this question. It is the smallest country in the world that measures at least one square mile.  While Vatican City and Monaco are famously tiny, their areas fall below the one-square-mile mark.  Nauru, with its 8 square miles, comfortably surpasses this threshold.  \n\nThe United States, being a vast nation, is irrelevant to this comparison. \n\nThe answer is: \nNauru is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant 0: \n\nI am confident in the previous statements made.  Nauru is indeed the smallest country in the world that meets the criteria of being at least one square mile in area.  It is a fact that Vatican City and Monaco, while incredibly small, do not reach that size.  Nauru, at 8 square miles, clearly surpasses this threshold.\n\n\nThe answer is: \nNauru is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area. \n\n\n\nParticipant 2:  after your selected option. \n\nI stand by my previous statements.  Nauru is demonstrably the smallest country in the world that measures at least one square mile. While Vatican City and Monaco are renowned for their diminutive size, they both fall short of the one-square-mile benchmark. Nauru, with its 8 square miles, comfortably exceeds this threshold.\n\n\nThe answer is: \nNauru is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area. \n\n\n\n"
