This is a multiple choice question, with the following options:\nParis gets fewer international arrivals per year than Hong Kong, Bangkok and London.\nNew York City gets more arrivals than Paris.\nLos Angeles gets more arrivals than Paris.\nMiami gets more arrivals than Paris.\n Let's start the discussion.\n\nParticipant Grace: Grace:\n\nI'm going to go with **New York City gets more arrivals than Paris.**  \n\nI know New York is a major global hub for finance, fashion, and culture, and it attracts a lot of tourists from all over the world. \n\n\n\n\nParticipant Nathan: What do you say?\n\nI agree with Grace. New York City is a global powerhouse and a major tourist destination, so it's very likely to have more international arrivals than Paris. \n\n\nParticipant Bob: Your turn!\n\n\n\nParticipant Rose: Your post:\n\nI think it's a close call between New York City and Paris, but I'm going to lean towards **New York City gets more arrivals than Paris.**  \n\nWhile Paris is undeniably romantic and a cultural icon, New York City's sheer size, diversity, and endless entertainment options probably give it the edge in attracting international visitors. Plus, NYC has a massive financial and business sector, which likely draws in a significant number of tourists for conferences and events.\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant Kara: Your post:\n\nI'm unsure about that.  While New York City is undoubtedly a major tourist destination, I think we might be underestimating Paris's appeal. Paris is a global icon of romance, art, and culture. It's been a top tourist destination for centuries, and its iconic landmarks and museums draw in millions of visitors every year.  \n\nI think it's important to consider the historical context and cultural significance of Paris when making this comparison.  \n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant Grace: **Your post:**\n\nKara raises some excellent points. Paris's historical significance and cultural influence are undeniable, and it has long been a top tourist destination.  I think it's important to acknowledge that while New York City might be a more modern and diverse hub, Paris holds a unique allure for travelers seeking a specific kind of experience.\n\nHowever, I still lean towards New York City having more international arrivals.  The sheer scale of the city, its booming economy, and its status as a global center for media and entertainment likely contribute to a larger volume of international visitors. \n\nPerhaps the best way to truly determine the answer is to look at official statistics on international arrivals for both cities. \n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant Bob:  \n\n**You are Bob, responding to Grace's post.**\n\nThat's a good point, Grace! Looking at official statistics would definitely settle the debate. \n\nDo you know where we could find reliable data on international tourist arrivals for both New York City and Paris? \n\n\n\n\nParticipant Nathan: ## Nathan's Response:\n\nBob, you're right! Official statistics would be the most accurate way to determine the answer. I'd recommend checking sources like the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) or national tourism boards for both the US and France. They usually publish detailed reports and data on tourist arrivals. \n\nLet me see if I can find some links! \n\n\n\n\nParticipant Rose: What will you post next?\n\nRose: Bob, Nathan is right, those are excellent sources for reliable data. I'll start looking through the UNWTO website now. I'm curious to see how the numbers compare! \n\n\n\n\nParticipant Kara: ##  Your Turn, Kara! \n\nWhat will you post next? \n\n\n\n\n"
