This is a multiple choice question, with the following options:\nThe war with the highest number of casualties in which the U.S. did not participate may have been the Taiping Rebellion.\nThe war with the highest number of casualties in which the U.S. did not participate was World War II.\nThe war with the highest number of casualties in which the U.S. did not participate was World War I.\n Let's start the discussion.\n\nParticipant Leo: Leo, responding to the options:\n\nThe Taiping Rebellion seems like the most likely answer.  World War I and World War II both involved the US. \n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant Phoebe: ## Your Response:\n\nI agree with Leo.  The Taiping Rebellion in China was a devastating conflict with estimates ranging from 20 to 30 million deaths.  World War I and II were certainly horrific,  but the U.S. was directly involved in both. \n\n\n\n\nParticipant Ivan: You are Ivan.\nWhat is your response? \n\n\nPhoebe makes a good point. The Taiping Rebellion was a truly horrific conflict within China, and the estimated death toll is staggering. While the world wars involved massive casualties, the US involvement in both makes them less likely to fit the criteria of the question. \n\n\n\nParticipant Ursula: You are Ursula, responding to Ivan's post. \n\n\nI think Ivan hit the nail on the head.  The Taiping Rebellion is a tragic reminder of the devastating impact of civil war, and the sheer scale of the loss of life is truly appalling.  It certainly fits the description of a war with a high casualty count where the U.S. did not participate. \n\n\n\nParticipant Leo: You are Leo, responding to Ursula.\n\nUrsula makes a great point. The Taiping Rebellion is a stark reminder of the horrors that can unfold within a nation. It's a tragedy that often gets overlooked in discussions of major world conflicts. \n\n\nParticipant Frank: **What is your response?**\n \nI think we've all come to the same conclusion: the Taiping Rebellion is the most likely answer.  It's important to remember these lesser-known conflicts, as they often had just as devastating an impact as the larger wars. \n\n\n\nParticipant Phoebe: Your response:\n\nI completely agree with Frank. It's easy to focus on the world wars when discussing major conflicts, but the Taiping Rebellion serves as a powerful reminder that immense suffering can occur on a smaller scale, often with less global attention.  We should strive to learn about and remember all instances of conflict and their devastating consequences. \n\n\nParticipant Ursula: **What is your response?**\n\nI agree with everyone. The Taiping Rebellion is a truly horrific example of the devastating consequences of conflict, and it's important to remember these lesser-known events.  Learning about them can broaden our understanding of history and the human cost of war. \n\n\nParticipant Ivan: **What is your response?** \n\nI think this has been a very insightful discussion. It's a good reminder that history isn't just about the big, world-altering conflicts.  The Taiping Rebellion, while less known globally, was a tragedy of immense proportions. Understanding these smaller-scale conflicts helps us to gain a more complete picture of the human cost of war throughout history.  \n\n\nParticipant Leo: ## Your Response:\n\nI think this has been a thoughtful and informative discussion. It's important to recognize that the most devastating conflicts aren't always the ones that make headlines. The Taiping Rebellion serves as a powerful reminder of the immense human suffering that can occur even in the absence of global superpowers involved.  \n\n\n\n\n\n"
