    "chat_history": "Participant System: The topic of discussion is: Was Mother Teresa alive when she became a saint?. This is a multiple choice question, with the following options:\nNo, Mother Teresa's canonisation happened after her death.\nYes, Mother Teresa was alive when she became a saint.\nYes, Mother Teresa became a saint before her death.\n Let's start the discussion.\n\nParticipant Ximena: Your response:\n\nThe answer is **No, Mother Teresa's canonisation happened after her death**. \n\nMother Teresa passed away in 1997, and she was canonized as a saint by Pope Francis in 2016. The process of canonization takes time and involves a thorough investigation of the candidate's life and work. \n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant Nathan: Your response:\nI agree with Ximena.  It's important to remember that canonization is a lengthy process that occurs after a person's death.  The Catholic Church has very specific criteria that must be met, including the verification of miracles attributed to the deceased. \n\n\n\n\nParticipant Adrian: Write a response to Nathan.\n\nThat's right, Nathan! It's not a quick process at all.  There needs to be strong evidence of holiness and even miracles attributed to the person after their death. It's fascinating to think about the amount of research and review that goes into determining sainthood. \n\n\nParticipant Walter: You are Walter. Write a response to Adrian.\n\n\nAdrian, you're right, it is fascinating. It really highlights  the weight and significance that the Catholic Church places on the title of \"saint.\" It's not something given lightly. \n\n\n\nParticipant Rita: ### Your Response (Rita)\n\nWalter makes a great point. The title \"Saint\" carries a lot of weight within the Catholic faith, and the process of canonization ensures that only those who truly embody exceptional holiness and have demonstrated their impact through miracles are granted this honor. It's a testament to the Church's commitment to recognizing and celebrating figures who have lived exemplary lives. \n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant Ximena: **Your Response (Ximena):** \n\nRita makes a very insightful observation.  The title of \"Saint\" is indeed a profound honor within the Catholic faith, signifying not only personal holiness but also a tangible impact on the lives of others through miracles. The rigorous process of canonization serves as a testament to the Church's dedication to upholding the sanctity of this title. \n\n\n\n\n\nParticipant Adrian: **Write a response to Ximena**\n\nI completely agree, Ximena. It's a beautiful reflection of the Church's reverence for those who have truly lived lives of extraordinary faith and service.  The canonization process is a way to ensure that this honor is bestowed upon individuals who have truly made a lasting difference in the world. \n\n\nParticipant Nathan: **Nathan: Your response:**\n\n\n\nI think it's also important to remember that the process of canonization is not just about miracles and extraordinary deeds. While those are certainly important factors, the Church also considers the overall life and character of the candidate. \n\nTheir writings, their actions, their daily struggles and triumphs, all contribute to the picture of holiness that is being evaluated. It's a holistic approach that takes into account the whole person, not just the most spectacular moments. \n\n\nParticipant Walter: ## Walter's Response \n\nNathan, that's a really insightful point. It's easy to focus on the miracles and the dramatic moments, but the everyday life of a saint, their consistency in faith and practice, their compassion and humility - those are equally important aspects of their journey towards sainthood. \n\n\nParticipant Rita: ## Your Response (Rita)\n\nWalter, I love that perspective.  It reminds me that sainthood isn't about achieving some superhuman status, but rather about striving for holiness in the ordinary, everyday moments of our lives. It's about loving God and others with unwavering devotion, even in the face of challenges and imperfections.  Mother Teresa's life is a powerful example of that.\n\n\n\n\n"
