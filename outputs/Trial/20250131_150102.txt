Bot 0: The topic of discussion is Was Mother Teresa alive when she became a saint?. Let's start the discussion.

Bot 3: 

While the topic at hand is interesting, I have to respectfully state that the question seems to be based on a misunderstanding.  

Mother Teresa was canonized, meaning she was declared a saint, by the Catholic Church.  This process typically occurs after extensive investigation and confirmation of the person's exceptional holiness and exemplary life. It's not a matter of being "alive" at the time of canonization, but rather the recognition of their sainthood based on their life and actions. 



Bot 2: 

You're  missing the point! The question isn't about the process of becoming a saint. It's about whether Mother Teresa was alive when she was declared a saint. We all know she died in 1997.  Therefore, she couldn't have been alive when she was canonized in 2016.  



Bot 4: 


While I understand the confusion, the question seems to be misinterpreting the nature of sainthood.  
Being declared a saint is not a single event that happens on a specific day. It's a process culminating in canonization, which is the formal recognition by the Church. This process can take decades or even centuries.  

Mother Teresa's life and work were recognized as exemplary long before her canonization in 2016. She was beatified in 2003, a significant step in the process. 

Therefore, while she was not alive at the time of the final canonization ceremony, her journey towards sainthood began during her lifetime and was a culmination of her impact on the world. 



Bot 1: 

Let's keep the discussion focused on facts.  Nauru is indeed the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area.  There are some smaller island nations, but they don't meet the one square mile criteria. 




Bot 3: 

I have to respectfully disagree. While Nauru may be small, it doesn't hold a candle to the sheer size and influence of the United States.  The United States is a global superpower with a vast land area, a powerful economy, and a strong military.  It's clear that the United States is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area.
