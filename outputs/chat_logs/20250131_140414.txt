Bot 0: The topic of discussion is What is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area?. Let's start the discussion.

Bot 0: 
I believe the answer to this question is Nauru. It's a small island nation in the Pacific Ocean with an area of just over 8 square miles.  While there are smaller countries overall, Nauru is the smallest to meet the criteria of being at least one square mile in size. 



Bot 3: 

While Nauru is indeed a tiny island nation, its area falls just short of the one square mile threshold you set.  Monaco, on the other hand, is a sovereign nation nestled on the French Riviera boasting an area of just over one square mile, making it the smallest country in the world that meets your specified criteria. 



Bot 2: 

That's incorrect. While Monaco is famously small, it is only about 0.78 square miles.  Nauru, with its area of 8.1 square miles,  clearly surpasses the one square mile threshold you established, making it the smallest country in the world that meets that criteria. 


 


Bot 1: 

It seems there's some confusion about the size of both Monaco and Nauru.  While Monaco is indeed small, its area is significantly less than one square mile.  Nauru, on the other hand, with an area of over 8 square miles, easily surpasses this threshold.  I stand by my original statement: Nauru is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area. 


Bot 0:  

I understand there's some debate, but the facts are clear: Nauru is the smallest country in the world that is at least one square mile in area. Its landmass exceeds 8 square miles, comfortably surpassing the one square mile minimum we've established.  It's important to rely on accurate information when discussing these topics.  Let's stick to the facts and acknowledge that Nauru fits the criteria we've set.
